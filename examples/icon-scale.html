title: Icon Scale
shortdesc: Example of scaling icons and labels.
docs: >
  Icons and labels can be scaled in both dimensions if required. A negative value will flip the image
  or text around its anchor point (reversed text is <b>not</b> suitable for line placement). A newline
  character inserted in label text is interpreted in a <b>vector layer</b>, but will not be shown in
  a <b>vector context</b>.
tags: [vector, style, icon, label, scale]
